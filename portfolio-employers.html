		  <p class="mb-4">BountyJobs core product provides a recruitment marketplace for enterprise employers who frequently use third-party search, giving them access to thousands of recruiters, as well as visibility into the performance of, and their spend on, those recruiters. I am the Senior UX/UI designer for this core product, utilizing my skills in user-centered design, communication and collaboration. I have been the sole UX/UI designer (and even the sole front-end developer for a time) over the last 8+ years. I have worked on many projects for BountyJobs over the years, here are a few examples:</p>

				<strong>Overhauling the employer application</strong>
				<p>The engineering team was tasked with completely overhauling the employer application. Extensive user research led to a UX design that was job-oriented and replaced email communication with chat-style communication. This eased the burden on the employer in communicating with recruiters by being able to answer mutliple recruiters at one time, as well as allowed for employers to give recruiters instruction on the job search and candidate requirements at one time. It gave users quicker access to candidates with 3 fewer clicks than the previous application and made reviewing resumes and rejecting or moving a candidate into the pipeline a one-click solution. Communicating that rejection or acceptance was systemized to keep recruiters informed without extensive effort on the employer's part. </p>

				<strong>Increasing submissions and fills</strong>
				<p><!--One of our main sets of employer users are human resource generalists who have a broad swath of duties, only one of which is recruiting and hiring candidates. To say these users are overwhelmingly busy all of the time is an understatement.-->Our technology does an awesome job of streamlining communications with individual recruiters, but we discovered that users were having a hard time using the system to clearly communicate their expectations and needs to all recruiters at one time at the start of a search. Through research, I found that in the offline world, every time an employer engaged a third-party recruiter they would have a call with that recruiter to tell them about their ideal candidate, the benefits and culture of their compnay and what the hiring process would look like. They might repeat this conversation with several recruiters working on one job. More research and brainstorming led to a solution via our technology that would allow employers to schedule, invite and hold one conference call with all the recruiters working on their job to kick off the search. Our goal was to save the employer time and make it easier to communicate their expectations. Those goals were met with the added bonus of increasing candidate submissions and job fills by 39% and 37%, respectively. </p>

				<strong>Measuring performance and spend</strong>
				<p>I was asked to take the canned reports that users could get by generating a CSV file for export and make them "pretty." Believe me, I have nothing against pretty, but I do have plenty against pretty for pretty's sake. I pushed and pushed at the business to find out why they wanted something other than the exportable reports, which were highly valued because a user could slice and dice that data however they needed. I didn't understand how visually showing the exact same data would provide any additional value. It became clear that one of our main product values was the data and insights we were able to provide and sales wanted a wow factor when demonstrating this point. Once I discovered the goal behind the ask, I could go about researching and designing a reporting suite that provided different information than the exported reports, highlighting spend across business units and recruiter performance in a way that answered specific questions users had about third-party search, and thus providing sales the wow factor and the user valuable insights.</p>

				<strong>Gaining control over which recruiters to select</strong>
				<p>A recruitment marketplace consisting of thousands of recruiters often leaves employers asking, "who is best-suited to fill my job?" "How do I choose?" Solving for this challenge has led to several enhancements to our engagement process over the years&mdash;tweaking which metrics to show, building a BountyJobs Recommends algorithm, starring favorites, and an "easy" button. We are now working on launching a beta that gives the user even further control by allowing them to filter through recruiters based on the criteria that is most important to them&mdash;recruiters with the highest fills, those who solely specialize in their industry or location, or recruiters whose candidates have a high percentage of being interviewed. The impetous for this project came from feedback I had long gathered via user testing, feedback, surveys and talking to the onbaording team. I took that feedback and put together the outline for a solution, championed the need for the solution to the business and successfully got the project scheduled on the product roadmap.</p>
